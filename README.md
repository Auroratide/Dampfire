# Dampfire

**Play here: https://auroratide.itch.io/dampfire**

A simple game made for [OMGJam 6](https://itch.io/jam/omgjam6) around the theme of "campfire". Buckets are trying to put out your fire, and you must stop them!

There's one mechanic: tap to destroy!

Tap buckets to destroy them before they reach the campfire! As buckets get through, your fire will get dimmer and it will become harder to see the incoming threats. Replenish your flames by allowing wood logs through instead.
